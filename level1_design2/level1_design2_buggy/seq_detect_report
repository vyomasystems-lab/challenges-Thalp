 sequence detector accepts as input a string of bits: either 0 or 1.
 Its output goes to 1 when a target sequence has been detected

in order to generate the sequence the sequence generator uses the 1011
await triggers uses in order to raise or fall the values of the with the 
help of positve edge and negative edge 

in order to generatethe sequence 10111 , the value declared to the input 
await will declares the value either its active high or active low.
it will be rising edge for active high ,it will be falling edge for active low 

in order to generate 1011 ,in test case we declaring values wrongly it leads to the error 
in the  below instead of declaring the value as 0(active low ) declaring as 1,it leads to the
error it lead to unreliable  eror 
dut.inp_bit.value=1
await FallingEdge(dut.clk)
