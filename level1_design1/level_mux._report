## multiplexer is a combinational circuit in order to reduce the number of logic gates ,
## in the same circuit we can implemnt  boolean function with the help of selction lines.

in order to select the required "output" selection lines are used for example 4:2 Multiplexers,
to select the combination of the thrid input ,both selection lines  will be active high .
selction combinations ~a~b,~ab,a~b,ab with input0,input1,input2,input3.

Test scenario:
for 16 inputs to the multiplexer in the source code , 16 values are declared in  the test case with 
help decalration names that to be driven to the source file
input driving will sync the inputs declared in the test case to the source file .
design under test(dut) .inp0.value ,implies the values we are declaring in the the test case
we directly mention  the value to the source file.
await will act as edge trigger and will mention the delay to the model
